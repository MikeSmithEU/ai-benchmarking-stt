Normalization
=============

Each normalization class has a method called `normalize`:

.. code-block:: python

    def normalize(text: str) -> str:
        """Returns normalized text with rules supplied by the called class.
        """

.. automodule:: conferatur.normalization.core
   :members:
   :undoc-members: normalize
   :inherited-members: normalize
