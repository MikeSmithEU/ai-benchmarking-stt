API
===

Conferatur exposes its functionality through a JSON-RPC_ api.

You can make the api available via:

    - :doc:`cli/api` (for debugging and local use only)
    - :doc:`docker`
    - gunicorn, by running :code:`start_gunicorn.sh` in the root repository folder

MORE DOCUMENTATION TO COME SOON.
